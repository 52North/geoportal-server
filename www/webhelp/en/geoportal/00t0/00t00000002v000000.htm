                <h3>How to Use the Geoportal Search Widget for Flex</h3><p id="GUID-82F6DD92-8725-4DBC-B90D-4092EAC4844F"> &nbsp;When the Geoportal Search Widget for Flex is properly integrated into your Flex 
                Viewer, you should be able to launch a <b>Find Data</b> widget from the interface. This 
                Find Data window is the Geoportal Search Widget for Flex. To launch it, hover 
                your mouse pointer over the cube <b>Tools</b> icon in the viewer&#39;s main menu, and you 
                will see the <b>Find Data</b> tool displayed in the list of available tools. Click on 
                it to launch the Find Data user interface.</p></div><div class="section2" id="OTHERTOOLSINFINDDATA" purpose="section2"><h4>
            How to search for resources</h4><p id="GUID-DCCE1FEB-87A7-47B5-BE6B-B822FD76B140">
                Notice that the <span class="wintitle">Find Data</span> window has one input field, a <span class="uicontrol">Search</span> button, and three radio buttons. The input field accepts any lucene search query. You can type in a simple query, such as just one keyword to search, or you can develop more complex queries using the <a class="xref" rel="00t0/00t000000004000000.htm" href="00t0/00t000000004000000.htm">Lucene syntax</a>.&nbsp; Furthermore, you can limit search results to a certain spatial extent. Select the appropriate radio button: <span class="uicontrol">Anywhere</span> means no spatial filter will be applied, <span class="uicontrol">Intersecting</span> will retrieve records that touch or overlap the spatial extent currently shown in the Flex Viewer, and <span class="uicontrol">Fully Within</span> will retrieve records where the spatial extent falls fully within the extent currently shown in the Flex Viewer. Once you have entered the search criteria, click the <span class="uicontrol">Search</span> button.</p>
            <p>
                Search results matching your criteria are returned. Doubleclick on one of the records, and the interface zooms to the spatial extent of the resource. Another window appears, showing information for that search result resource and links that provide the same functionality that you'd see on the geoportal search page. You will notice that no <span class="uicontrol">Preview</span> link is generated, and instead an <span class="uicontrol">Add to Map</span> link appears for Live Data. That is because in this Flex application, users preview the service when they chose to add it to the map with the <span class="uicontrol">Add to Map</span> link.</p>
            <h4>
                Other tools in the Find Data window</h4>
            <p>At the top right side of the <span class="wintitle">Find Data</span> window, there are four icons. The first is a set of binoculars, and the second is a square chart. These two buttons allow for toggling between the search interface and the list of resources. Click on the binoculars to define a search; click on the chart to see the results from the previous search. The third and fourth buttons define the behavior of the window itself. Click on the green arrow to minimize the window. Click on the <span class="uicontrol">X</span> button to close it.</p><p id="GUID-894D872A-4E59-46C8-BCDD-CDA448DFA81B">If you close the window, but want to open it again, hover the pointer over the cube <span class="uicontrol">Tools</span> icon in the viewer's main menu, and you will see the <span class="wintitle">Find Data</span> tool displayed in the list of available tools. Click on it to restore it to the <span class="wintitle">Find Data</span> user interface.</p></div><div class="section2" id="VIEWSERVICEFLEX" purpose="section2"><h4>Viewing a service in the interface</h4><p id="GUID-79A5BBF1-FB31-4BAE-A814-ED85AF513A24">
            The Flex Viewer should support adding a variety of web services to the map, 
            including ArcIMS, ArcGIS Server REST services, OGC WMS, and GeoRSS. If a service 
            is not running or is of an unsupported service type, it will not appear on the 
            map interface even though an <b>Add to Map</b> link is displayed with the search 
            result.</p></div><div class="section2" id="NAVIGATEFLEXMAP" purpose="section2"><h4>How to navigate the Flex Viewer map</h4>Documentation for how to use the Flex Viewer is specific to its implementing organization, and will be defined in the Flex Viewer's help by the organization hosting the viewer.</div></div>
