Visitors to the geoportal can search and access these resources to use with their projects. If you grant them permission, visitors can also register geospatial resources with the geoportal. Geoportals give you an enterprise-level view of your geospatial resources regardless of their type or location. Resources are registered with a geoportal using metadata, which describes the location, age, quality, and other characteristics of the resources. With access to this information about resources, an organization can make decisions based on the best resources available.\r\nGeoportal Server has been hosted on SourceForge since 2010. We are in the process of migrating to GitHub as part of Esri's larger effort to support developers of the Esri platform with open source apps, samples, and SDK. Stay tuned for updates of this migration process.\r\n\r\nWith the Geoportal Server you can:\r\n* Improve the efficiency and effectiveness of geospatial activities within your enterprise and across organizations.\r\n* Support collaboration and cooperation among departments and organizations by facilitating the sharing of geospatial resources regardless of the GIS platform.\r\n* Gain an enterprise-level awareness of disparate geospatial data, Web services, and activities.\r\n* Leverage existing geospatial resources so your organization doesn't duplicate those resources or the effort to create them.\r\n* Ensure the use of approved, high-quality datasets.\r\n* Reduce the time users spend trying to find relevant, usable geospatial resources.\r\n\r\nWant to learn more?
